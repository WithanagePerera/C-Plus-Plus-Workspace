// Heap is a special tree-based data structure where the tree is a complete binary tree
// The binary search tree is an ordered data structure, the heap is not
// THat means in memory, the heap is usually represented as an array of numbers
// The heap can either be a min-heap or a max-heap
// The difference is that the root of the tree is the largest number for the max-heap
// The root is the smallest number for the min-heap
